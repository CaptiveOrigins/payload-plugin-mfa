# Decisions

Dated decisions for this repo, newest last.

- 2026-11-10: created from the ops starter kit, area `captive-origins`.
- 2026-11-10: Plugin Security leads this repo (assigned by Helm). Platform wires it into captive-origins and does the independent pre-publish security read. It goes public from the first push after that audit, with MIT.
- 2026-11-10: design proposed in docs/adr/0001-design.md, before any code (rules/build-it-right.md).
- 2026-11-10: ADR 0001 updated for Platform's pre-publish read (every Must and Should taken; see its last section).
- 2026-11-10: 0.1.0 built to ADR 0001, with 19 tests; four protections checked to fail their tests when removed.
